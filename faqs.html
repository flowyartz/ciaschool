                <h1>Frequently asked questions</h1>
                <p>The Academic Department of CIA FIRST International School hopes that you are in good health as you
                    read this letter. We understand that you have any questions on how learning will continue now that
                    we are switching to online learning due to the threat of Covid-19 in Phnom Penh. To help you ease
                    into this transition, we have prepared some Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) for your reference.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p><strong>How does online learning work?</strong><br>Online learning is education that takes place
                    using the internet. Over the years, many of you have been accustomed to submitting work online
                    through the use of Google Classroom. Today, Monday, March 16th, we will transition to fully online
                    learning, and you are expected to work independently on your learning with your teachers’ guidance
                    in every subject you are studying<br><br><strong>How can my teacher teach me?</strong><br>Your
                    teachers will upload all their lessons on Google Classroom. This is going to be interesting because
                    your teachers will be as creative as they can be to ensure that you are engaged with your materials.
                    As you go along with your lessons, your teachers will give you timely feedback to help you in the
                    areas that need improvement. It is very important that as you work on your activities, keep your
                    communication constant with your teacher to ensure you are receiving the assistance you
                    need.<br><br><strong>Do I have to do all the lessons and activities that my teachers post on Google
                        Classroom?</strong><br>There are two types of assessments that your teachers use: formative
                    (ungraded) and summative (graded which includes PT, EQs, HoM journal, and skills and knowledge
                    quiz), and both are used to help them identify the right support you need. Although formative
                    activities are not graded, it is very important that you engage and work on the activities to give
                    your teacher an overview of what you are currently learning and understanding. </p>
