                <p>At CIA FIRST International School, we believe in the “whole child” education. Every student from
                    kindergarten through grade 12 gets English-language, arts, mathematics, social studies, music,
                    visual and performing arts, natural sciences and physical education as core subjects.<br><br>CIA
                    FIRST extra- and co-curricular activities complement the academic disciplines. Students may join
                    sports teams, student government, band, choir, visual arts, and more. High school students may
                    choose College Board Advanced Placement courses.<br><br>At CIA FIRST International School we
                    integrate the 16 Habits of Mind in the learning process. The Habits of Mind is a set of 16 thinking
                    skills for self-directed and lifelong learners. The understanding and application of these skills
                    serve to aid students in working through real-life problems by using intentional strategies to gain
                    positive outcomes.<br><br>Our unique curriculum and its accompanying extra- and co-curricular
                    activities equip every CIA FIRST student with a breadth of experiences that produce the most
                    well-rounded students in Cambodia. All students have opportunities to explore and cultivate their
                    talents, setting them up to lead fruitful and fulfilling lives.</p>
